- 👋 Hi, I’m sabrine dhaouadi
- 👀 I’m interested in Whole Genome Annotation and would like to learn how to use PGAP for bacterial genome annotation including chromosomes and plasmids.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PGAP basics following Beginner's guides webinars 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on development projects and get involved in larger open-source projects as GitHub is the best place to start.
- 📫 How to reach me @s.dhaouadi@bham.ac.uk and on twitter: @sabrinedhaouadi
